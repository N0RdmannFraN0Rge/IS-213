## Group introduction

We are a group of 6 students and call ourselves *CDDJJT*. The name is just the first letter in our names in alphabetical order. Five of us created this group during the first semester and we have stuck together since then. Jørgen joined the group during the third semester. Working with each other for such a long time have revealed the strengths and weaknesses of each member and taught us that we work best while combining our skills. Some of us are good at writing detailed reports while others are good at coding. Great teamwork has proven to produce fantastic results.
