# OpenRT

OpenRT (Open Remote Trigger) is a system for remotely triggering various events.
In our project we want the trigger to remote control different lights that are placed on a lecturers desc. All the students in the room can use their own phone and our application to indicate on what level they understand what the lecturer is teaching. The lights on the desc will then light up to show the lecturer if something needs to be repeated or if everything is clear. Due to the fact that many students are shy and afraid of speaking out loud when something is not clear, this gives them the opportunity to give feedback anonymously. 
The product of the project can also be used for other purposes like triggering a sound, a motor or other devices. 

The aim of this project is mainly to provide a tool for the lecturer to recieve feedback while teaching.
