In this documentation we mention two different roles. To avoid confusion we describe these below:

1. *Contributor* - The individual who writes the changes to the code and submits them for evaluation.
1. *Reviewer* - The individual who checks and makes sure that changes are legit and follows the given standards.

### Branches

In this repository there are two different types of branches:

1. Master branch
1. Topic branches

There are three topic branches. When contributing, make sure you are working in the correct branch:

1. Branch for phone application code
1. Branch for Arduino code
1. Branch for WiFi module code

### Standards

These are the standards that are expected to be followed when contributing to OpenRT. Reviewers are also expected to check that submitted code follows these standards.

#### Code Standards

Follow basic programming principles. These includes:
* Class, method, variable names should be descriptive
* Class names should use camel case, first letter capitalized (e.g. ClassName)
* Method and variable names should use camel case, first letter lower case (e.g. methodName)
* Low degree of code duplication
* High degree of cohesion
* Low degree of coupling
Preferably, each segment of code should be explained with a comment.
